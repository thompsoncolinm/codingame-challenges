If I have this query:

<img src="./img/Screenshot 2024-10-20 122225.png" />

```sql
-- SQL request(s) below
SELECT *
FROM product
```

How can I modify the query to select only the products with a price strictly greater than 100? Results should be ordered by price in descending order. Output exactly the `PRODUCT_ID`, `NAME`, and `PRICE` columns as in the example below:

Got it! Here’s how you can modify your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT PRODUCT_ID, NAME, PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE PRICE > 100
ORDER BY PRICE DESC;
```

This will give you the products with a price greater than 100, ordered by price in descending order, and output the `PRODUCT_ID`, `NAME`, and `PRICE` columns as specified. Does that work for you?

If I have this code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Solution
{
    public static int ComputeClosestToZero(int[] ts)
    {
        // Write your code here
        // To debug: Console.Error.WriteLine("Debug messages...");
        
        return -1;
    }

    /* Ignore and do not change the code below */
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string[] inputs;
        int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        int[] ts = new int[n];
        inputs = Console.ReadLine().Split(' ');
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            ts[i] = int.Parse(inputs[i]);
        }
        var stdtoutWriter = Console.Out;
        Console.SetOut(Console.Error);
        int solution = ComputeClosestToZero(ts);
        Console.SetOut(stdtoutWriter);
        Console.WriteLine(solution);
    }
    /* Ignore and do not change the code above */
}
```

Here's how you can write the `ComputeClosestToZero` method to find the integer in the array `ts` that's closest to zero:

```csharp
public static int ComputeClosestToZero(int[] ts)
{
    if (ts == null || ts.Length == 0)
        return 0; // Assuming no temperatures means closest to 0 is 0

    int closest = ts[0];
    
    foreach (int temp in ts)
    {
        if (Math.Abs(temp) < Math.Abs(closest) || 
            (Math.Abs(temp) == Math.Abs(closest) && temp > closest))
        {
            closest = temp;
        }
    }
    
    return closest;
}
```

This method initializes the `closest` variable with the first element of the array. Then it iterates through each element in the array and updates `closest` if it finds a temperature that is closer to zero or, if the temperature is equally close, the positive one.

Does that help? Give it a whirl and let me know how it works!

I got this question and answered `git fetch`. Was that wrong?

I see. It looks like you were asked about maintaining a linear commit history when pulling changes. In that case, the correct command would be:

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

The `git fetch` command fetches changes from the remote repository but does not integrate them with your local branch. `git pull --rebase` fetches the changes and then rebases your local commits on top of the fetched changes, keeping the commit history linear.

So, yeah, `git fetch` wasn’t wrong per se, just not the complete solution for maintaining a linear history. Easy to mix up!

Given this code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Solution
{
    public static int CalculateTotalPrice(int[] prices, int discount)
    {
        // Write your code here
        // To debug: Console.Error.WriteLine("Debug messages...");
        
        return -1;
    }

    /* Ignore and do not change the code below */
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string[] inputs;
        int discount = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        int[] prices = new int[n];
        inputs = Console.ReadLine().Split(' ');
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            prices[i] = int.Parse(inputs[i]);
        }
        var stdtoutWriter = Console.Out;
        Console.SetOut(Console.Error);
        int price = CalculateTotalPrice(prices, discount);
        Console.SetOut(stdtoutWriter);
        Console.WriteLine(price);
    }
    /* Ignore and do not change the code above */
}
```

Here's how to solve it:

```csharp
public static int CalculateTotalPrice(int[] prices, int discount)
{
    if (prices == null || prices.Length == 0)
        return 0;

    // Sort the prices in descending order to apply the discount to the highest price
    Array.Sort(prices);
    Array.Reverse(prices);

    // Apply the discount to the most expensive item
    prices[0] = prices[0] * (100 - discount) / 100;

    // Calculate the total price
    int totalPrice = 0;
    foreach (int price in prices)
    {
        totalPrice += price;
    }

    return totalPrice;
}
```
The calculation `prices[0] * (100 - discount) / 100` is used to apply a discount to the first item in the `prices` array. Let's break it down step by step:

### Accessing the First Price: `prices[0]`

This retrieves the first element from the `prices` array. For example, if `prices` is `[200, 150, 100]`, then `prices[0]` would be `200`.

### Calculating the Discounted Percentage: `100 - discount`

Here, `discount` is subtracted from `100` to determine the percentage of the price that remains after the discount is applied. For instance, if the discount is `20`, then `100 - 20` equals `80`, meaning `80%` of the original price remains.

### Applying the Discount: `prices[0] * (100 - discount) / 100`

This multiplies the original price by the remaining percentage (after the discount) and then divides by `100` to convert the percentage into a decimal form. For example, if the original price is `200` and the discount is `20`, the calculation would be:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 200 \times \frac{80}{100} = 160 \]

So, the discounted price would be `160`.

### Example

If you have:

```csharp
int[] prices = {200, 150, 100};
int discount = 20;
```

The calculation `prices[0] * (100 - discount) / 100` would result in `160` for the first item.

### Summary

This formula effectively reduces the original price by the specified discount percentage, giving you the final price after the discount is applied.

This will calculate the total price with the discount applied to the most expensive item and return the result. Give it a shot and see if it works for you!

Based on the image you uploaded, here's how to solve the problem to find the integer closest to zero:

```csharp
public static int closestToZero(int[] numbers)
{
    if (numbers == null || numbers.Length == 0)
        return 0;

    int closest = numbers[0];

    foreach (int number in numbers)
    {
        if (Math.Abs(number) < Math.Abs(closest) || 
            (Math.Abs(number) == Math.Abs(closest) && number > closest))
        {
            closest = number;
        }
    }

    return closest;
}
```

This method first checks if the input array is null or empty, returning 0 if so. It then iterates over each number, comparing the absolute values to find the one closest to zero, favoring positive numbers if there's a tie.

Does this align with the requirements in the image? Try it out!

Alright, based on the task from the image, here’s how you can write the `helloProperties(obj)` function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function helloProperties(obj) {
  // Create an empty array to hold the result
  const result = [];
  
  // Loop through each property in the object
  for (let key in obj) {
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      // Add the prefix "Hello-" to each property name and add it to the array
      result.push("Hello-" + key);
    }
  }
  
  // Return the resulting array
  return result;
}
```

This function will iterate over each property in the object, prefix it with "Hello-", and add it to an array which is then returned.

Give it a go and see if it fits the requirements!

To sort results alphabetically in SQL, you can use the `ORDER BY` clause. Here’s a simple example:

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC;
```

The `ASC` keyword sorts the results in ascending (alphabetical) order. If you wanted to sort in descending order (Z to A), you would use `DESC` instead.

Give it a go and see how it works for you! If you want to share more details, I can tailor the solution further.

To avoid displaying duplicates in your SQL query, you can use the `DISTINCT` keyword. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC;
```

This query will return only unique values in `column_name`, sorted alphabetically. Does that answer your question?
